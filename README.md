# Mini-Web-Site

This the code of a mini web site developpement that I've carried with tree others students in the context of a college project.
As junior computer science students, we developped the full site in HTML5 and CSS3.
Personnally, I wass in charge of the competences pages.
Competences such as responsive design, nav-bar managing or group working were those which I got after this project.

###
The main page is uploaded in this folder through the file PageD'accueil.html.

###
Any IDE can be used to execute the code.
